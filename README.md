# Quacker

Quacker is closely related to a popular micro-blogging application. Users can view all of the quacks posted by other users. Users who are logged in can post, modify, and delete their own quacks.

This project is a single-page app implementation of [Chitter](https://github.com/deniseyu/octochat), which was originally built in Ruby/Sinatra.
